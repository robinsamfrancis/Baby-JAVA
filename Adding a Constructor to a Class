// ADDING A CONSTRUCTOR

//Storing the values into the object takes a lots of memory and it will be difficult
// to enter values if there are many objects in the class. Therefore constructors 
// basically eliminates this need.

// Constructor name should be the exact same as the class name of the method.
//Its a method that basically returns nothing back.
//We don't have to mention void or anything in front of the constructor
